Stereotypes contain a lot of information about the gender stereotypes about children, but they mainly relate to their perception of groups in terms of appearance and their activities and our society. They describe how members of a social group typically behave; this is referred to as descriptive stereotypes (Eckes, 2008; Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Rudman & Glick, 2010). Compared to adults, there are also fewer characteristics that apply to children. Stereotypes contain a lot of information about the gender stereotypes about children, but mainly relate to their perception of groups in terms of appearance and activities and our society. They describe how members of a social group typically behave; this is referred to as descriptive stereotypes (Eckes, 2008; Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Rudman & Glick, 2010). A subgroup of stereotypes means that boys are subject to more rules. Prescriptive stereotypes that contain information about how people should behave (Koenig, 2018; Sullivan et al., 2018). Since the studies come from the USA, these stereotypes are not necessarily transferable to German society. Therefore, in our study, the content of stereotypes, the so-called proscriptive stereotypes, describe what is undesirable or forbidden (Rudman & Glick, 2010). Descriptive, prescriptive, and proscriptive gender stereotypes about adults generally reflect gender stereotypes about 3-year-old children in Germany (Bakan, 1966).

• A trait is considered a descriptive stereotype if:

• (2) the independent samples t-test for the ratings of girls versus boys is significant, and
• (3) the effect size for the difference is larger than | d| > 0.4 (Rudman et al., 2012; Koenig 2018;
Sullivan et al., 2018).
• Prescriptive stereotypes are determined using similar criteria, but these stereotypes are derived from the desirability scales. For proscriptive stereotypes, the mean on the desirable trait scale must be below 4 (undesirable), and the criteria for significance and effect size are the same as for descriptive and prescriptive stereotypes.

The analysis of our data following the approach of Sullivan et al. (2018) showed that there is a lot of overlap in the assignment of items to the three categories. Very few characteristics are considered to be only typical OR desirable. Most of the time, several categories apply (see bar chart). An analysis showed that items that were considered typical and desirable for girls were strongly correlated (r = .88), as were boys (r = .89). The items with the strongest effect sizes in relation to desired behavior showed that girls were attributed to human-related toys, whereas boys were attributed to sports activities (see table). There is a smaller number of proscriptive stereotypes compared to descriptive and prescriptive stereotypes, which is consistent with the literature from the USA (Koenig, 2018; Sullivan et al., 2018).

The typical characteristics of boys and girls focused more on appearance and activities than on personality traits. For girls, these were play activities that were strongly related to people ("dolls," "princesses," "father-mother-child"). The activities rated as typical for boys were more focused on "things" ("cars," "dinosaurs"). The characteristics most strongly rated as desirable for girls were communal, warm characteristics, which were also attributed to women. (Hentschel et al., 2019).
Traits that were most prescriptive for boys included agentic characteristics, which are also attributed to men (Hentschel et al., 2019). Our results show that stereotypes about children differ from those about adults, but show similarities to the categories "agency" and "communion".
This survey shows for Germany that students believe that more traditional gender stereotypes apply to children.
