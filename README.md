# Distribution of effect sizes and Cronbach's alpha reliabilty estimates in the psychology literature 

Additional analyses of 

- Bodgan's (2025) dataset of effect sizes (psych publications from 2004 to 2024)

- Hussey et al.'s (2025) dataset of Cronbach's alpha estimates (psych publications from 1985 to 2013)

## TODO

- look into the impossible effect size - what proportion are extraction errors vs actually impossible values?
- Add random sampling and categorisation of what sort of effects or comparisons give rise to what magnitdue of effect sizes? 
- Clarify source of each ES 
  - Save journal list to disk.
  - eg was peta2 explicitly reported or recalculated from F test? is it definitely peta2 and not eta2? were r values in text or also tables?
